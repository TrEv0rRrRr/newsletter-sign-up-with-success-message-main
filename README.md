### What I learned

```js
validator
  .addField(
    "#email",
    [
      {
        rule: "required",
      },
      {
        rule: "email",
        errorMessage: "Valid email required",
      },
    ],
    {
      errorsContainer: "#email-error-msg",
    }
  )
  .onSuccess((e) => {
    const inputEmailValue = document.getElementById("email").value;
    localStorage.setItem("userEmail", inputEmailValue);
    console.log("Form enviado con Ã©xito!");
    setTimeout(() => {
      window.location.href = "/success-page/success.html";
    }, 800);
  })
  .onFail(() => {
    console.log("Form no enviado");
  });

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  const userEmail = localStorage.getItem("userEmail");
  if (userEmail) emailSpan.textContent = `${userEmail}.`;
});

dismissButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  window.location.href = "/main-page/index.html";
});
```

### Useful resources

- [JustValidate.js Library](https://just-validate.dev/docs/intro) - This library was very helpful for the form validation. It's very intuitive and easy to use.
